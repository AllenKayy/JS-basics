6. Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category
- Statically typed languages are langauges that follow type checking during compilation. Every detail about the variables and all the data types must be known before .the compiling process. In this type of language, once a variable is assigned a type, it can’t be assigned to some other variable of a different type.

As such, these checks will catch things like missing functions, invalid type arguments or a mismatch between a data value and type of variable it's assigned to before the program even has a chance to run the erroneous code and risk crashing.

Examples of statically types languages are: Java, C, C#, C++, Go, Kotlin, Swift

- Dynamically typed languages are langauges that its type checking takes place while the program runs (run-time). In this type of language, there is no need to specify the data type of each variable while writing code. It means that you can write pretty quickly since you do not have to specify types every time. Instead of halting operations, the compiler will ignore things like invalid type arguments or mismatched data -- instead, type checking will occur regularly during runtime. If the type checker detects an error, it will alert the developer and give them an opportunity to correct the code before the program crashes.

Examples of dynamically types languages are : JavaScript, Python, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Lisp

7. Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined’

- Null means that the object is empty and isn't pointing to any memory address.

- Undefined means that the object doesn't have any value, therefore undefined. This occurs when you create a variable and don't assign a value to it.
